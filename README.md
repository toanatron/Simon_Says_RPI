# Simon_Says_RPI

Game of Simon Says where every new round consists of a new sequence. Each level consists of that number of blinking LED (e.g. level 10, LED blinks 10 times). There are four different LEDs: Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow. The circuit is built to be interfaced with the Raspberry Pi 3B. It uses capacitor 0.1uF for switch debouncing. The circuit uses 4 different LEDs, one passive buzzer, 4 buttons(switches), 2 1k resistors, one NPN transistor (S8050), and one T cobbler.
